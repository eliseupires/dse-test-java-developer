# Batch Process Optimization

Describe the steps you would take to diagnose and improve the performance of a batch process that interacts with a database and an FTP server. 

Explain how you would identify bottlenecks, optimize database queries, improve logic execution, and enhance file transfer efficiency. 

Provide examples of tools or techniques you would use during the analysis.

## Solution


### Diagnosing and Improving Batch Process Performance
- **Break down the workflow:** Identify major steps like data extraction from DB, processing logic, and FTP upload/download.

---

### Identify bottlenecks

- **Add logging/timing** around each major step (DB queries, processing logic, FTP transfers) to measure duration and throughput.
- Use **profiling tools** or built-in timers in the code.
- Monitor **system resources** (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network) during batch runs using tools like:
- Use **APM tools** (Application Performance Monitoring) like New Relic, Dynatrace, or Datadog for deeper insights.

---

### Database Interaction

#### Identify slow queries

- Enable **database slow query logging** (e.g., MySQL slow query log, SQL Server Profiler).
- Use **EXPLAIN plans** to analyze query execution paths.


#### Optimize queries

- **Add appropriate indexes** to frequently queried columns.
- Rewrite queries to avoid full table scans, unnecessary joins, or subqueries.
- Fetch only required columns, limit data retrieved.
- Batch multiple queries into a single transaction or use bulk operations.
- Consider **materialized views** or caching for expensive computations.
- If possible, use **stored procedures** for complex logic to reduce network round-trips.

### Enhance FTP Transfer Efficiency

#### FTP interaction

- Measure **upload/download speeds**.
- Check for **network latency**, bandwidth limitations.
- Verify if the FTP server supports **parallel/multiple connections**.

#### Optimize file transfer

- Compress files before transfer to reduce size (e.g., gzip, zip).
- Use **binary mode** if transferring binary files to avoid corruption and retransmission.
- Use **FTP clients supporting parallel streams** or segmented download/upload.
- Switch to more efficient protocols if possible, like **SFTP, FTPS**, or **rsync**.

- For large files, consider splitting into chunks and uploading in parallel.

---

### Automate and Monitor

- Add **automated performance tests** for batch runs.
- Set up **alerting** for slowdowns or failures.
- Continuously monitor logs, system metrics, and business metrics.
