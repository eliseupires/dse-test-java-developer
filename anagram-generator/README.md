# Anagram Project

Write a Java program to solve the following problem:

You are tasked with creating a utility function for a text-processing application. The function must generate all possible anagrams from a given group of distinct letters. For example, the input {a, b, c} should return the output: abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba.
Additional Requirements:
- The program should accept any group of distinct letters as input and produce the correct result.
- Optimize for readability and clarity.
- Include basic validation (e.g., ensure the input is non-empty and contains only letters).
- Write unit tests to validate your function with at least three different test cases, including edge cases (e.g., input with a single letter or empty input).
- Document your code clearly, explaining the logic for generating anagrams.
